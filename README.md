### PCA Art

This is a fun side project I took on following my completion of [Minerva's](minerva.kgi.edu) Undergraduate Machine Learning course. It allows you to dump in some images you have, it'll run principle component analysis on those images down to a 2d representation, allows you to pick a point in that 2d space for reconstruction (preferably far from any clusters you see), then makes funky art!

You'll need to be able to run the jupyter notebook. The data I used is provided in the repo but I encourage you to use your own and see what happens.
